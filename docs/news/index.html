                <div>
                    <p>Today, the Dancing Bears Park near the town of Belitsa is an ongoing success story. More than 20
                        former
                        dancing bears live in a 120.000 m² area under natural conditions which – step by step – help
                        them
                        learn
                        to lead a life as bears. The compound is divided into seven enclosures which enable the expert
                        staff
                        to
                        separate them into friendly groups and thus keep territorial problems raised by such a dense
                        population
                        at bay and stimulate their individual recovery. Almost all bears are hibernating in the winters
                        –
                        something they could not do in their lives as dancing bears, and which is an exceptionally good
                        sign
                        for
                        their progress. </p>
                    <h2>The end of suffering</h2>
                    <p>Trained on hot iron plates as cubs, who were separated from their mothers way too early,
                        mutilated
                        without anaesthesia with rings pierced through their noses – the most sensitive parts of their
                        bodies –
                        and fed on garbage and sugar: the tradition of training bears to dance is a remnant from the
                        Middle
                        Ages. Bears cannot hear well, let alone experience music. The only sound a bear can dance to is
                        a
                        trigger effect – a dance of fear.</p>

                <p>In the late 1990s tourists had become aware of the existence of dancing bears on the Black Sea coast
                    and
                    big
                    cities of Bulgaria and called the attention of FOUR PAWS to the situation. A small research unit was
                    sent to
                    the region and returned with results that disclosed a bleak status quo: more than 20 bears were
                    still
                    being
                    used as tourist attractions, the legal situation did not offer much room for intervention, and the
                    Roma
                    families involved in the business appeared keen on maintaining their tradition. </p>

                    <p>Further endeavours did however break the ice and offered initial possibilities to take measures
                        against
                        the gruesome practice. When it was clear that a lasting solution for the bears should be
                        realised on
                        Bulgarian soil, a suitable habitat for the animals was found near the town of Belitsa, a vast
                        mountain
                        region that offered secluded spots. Due to the high costs of building a maintainable refuge in
                        accordance with the highest standards, FOUR PAWS needed a strong, long-term partner. The
                        Brigitte
                        Bardot
                        Foundation agreed to co-fund the project and has been a reliable associate ever since.</p>
                    <p>The first set-up of the project contained three sectors with an area of 11 000 sq. m. and an
                        information
                        and mainenance building. Meanwhile, talks with the families keeping bears resulted in transfer
                        options
                        that seemed workable for all parties involved. In 2000 the first three bears were rescued:
                        Kalina,
                        Mariana and Stefan. Soon more bears were to follow them. It became clear that the initial layout
                        of
                        the
                        park had to be rapidly widened and in 2004 twelve additional hectares and a big info centre with
                        a
                        medical room were added to the sanctuary.</p>

                    <p>What had seemed like a faraway goal in the year 2000 became a fact in 2007, as Mima, Svetla and
                        Misho
                        -
                        the last three dancing bears of Bulgaria and the EU – were transferred to the Dancing Bears
                        Park.
                        Two
                        years later tha last three dancing bears from the Republic of Serbia were also accommodated at
                        the
                        park.
                        Incredible progress occurred between the start of the project and the present day: it is now
                        illegal
                        to
                        keep dancing bears in Bulgaria, the Dancing Bears Park has grown to ten times its original size
                        and
                        harbours all of the remaining former dancing bears in Bulgaria as well as two Serbian bears. A
                        state-of-the-art medical centre and a dedicated staff have turned the FOUR PAWS sanctuary into a
                        milestone of modern animal welfare.</p>

                        the
                        bears, who are often too old and medically fragile to give birth without complications, but
                        would
                        also
                        doom the cubs to spend all their life in captivity, as cubs born to animals in captivity could
                        never
                        learn to live independently in the wilderness. A sanctuary is not a zoo.</p>
                    <p>A return to natural instincts is encouraged on all levels. The feeding procedures mimic the daily
                        lives
                        of animals in the wild: the professional staff is dispersing the food throughout the enclosures,
                        so
                        the
                        bears essentially need to spend a substantial amount of their time to find the food.</p>
                    <p>Almost all dancing bears rescued by FOUR PAWS have sooner or later started to hibernate in the
                        winter
                        –
                        many of them have dug their own dens. A major achievement in the recovery process of these
                        deprived
                        animals!</p>

                    <p>The Dancing Bears Park offers its inhabitants dense forests and hills for roaming and seclusion,
                        meadows
                        and specially designed sunny places for rest, ponds for swimming and artificial dens for those
                        bears
                        who
                        do not dig their own hibernation caves right away. The current park covers 120.000 m² of land;
                        the
                        length of the fence enclosing all sectors is 3.326 m, connected through 1.150 pylons. Service
                        roads
                        and
                        paths cover 5.115 m. There are two information buildings – one in the original part and one in
                        the
                        extension. A medical centre allows even the most complicated veterinary procedures to be
                        performed.
                        The
                        safety of both bears and visitors is guaranteed by 26.608 m of electric shepherd wire – 105
                        lamps
                        are
                        installed for night surveillance. The park has 16 service doors and another 12 gates giving
                        access
                        to
                        its internal area. Each sector has its own pond; there is a total of twelve man-made dens, three
                        of
                        which can be accessed directly from the medical centre. Information centre 2 can be used as a
                        venue
                        for
                        lectures and discussions and offers free wireless internet access to the visitors.</p>

                    <p>Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in endotherms. Hibernation refers to a season of heterothermy characterized by low body-temperature, slow breathing and heart-rate, and low metabolic rate. It most commonly occurs during winter months.</p>

                    <p>Hibernation functions to conserve energy when sufficient food is unavailable. To achieve this energy saving, an endothermic animal decreases its metabolic rate and thereby its body temperature. Hibernation may last days, weeks, or months - depending on the species, ambient temperature, time of year, and the individual's body-condition. Before entering hibernation, animals need to store enough energy to last through the duration of their dormant period, possibly as long as an entire winter. Larger species become hyperphagic, eating a large amount of food and storing the energy in fat deposits. In many small species, food caching replaces eating and becoming fat.</p>
